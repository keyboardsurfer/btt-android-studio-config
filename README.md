## What's in here?

This is my configuration file for the TouchBar and Android Studio.

It works with [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)

## Here's how it looks

When you open Android Studio
![Regular](assets/regular.png "Regular")

Handy debugging shortcuts
![Debugging](assets/debugging.png "Debugging view")

And of course some run configurations
![Run Configurations](assets/run-config.png "Run Configurations")

## How to use it

  * Get [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
  * Get the [config file](btt-android-studio-config.json?raw=true)
  * Import the config file into BTT by going to Preferences->Manage Presets->Import
  * Switch to Android Studio
  * Profit

## Known limitations

The current configuration is set to work with the Android Studio EAP.
